Global availability
Caching and reliability

● What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?
react.development.js:
Unminified
Includes helpful warnings, error messages
Used during development

react.production.js:
Minified and optimized
No warnings or debug info
Used in production (live websites)

-----------------------------------------------

● What is async and defer?
Both control how scripts are loaded asynchronously to avoid blocking the HTML parsing.
Use async when script doesn’t depend on others.
Use defer when order matters and script interacts with DOM.
